My former robotics team got a new CNC router and I suggested for them to get an enclosure to reduce noise and mess. I couldn’t find a good CNC router enclosure at a decent price, so I decided to design and build one for them. I had a couple design requirements going into this design. Firstly, I had to make the smallest enclosure possible while still providing space inside for the CNC router to move around unrestricted. There isn’t much space available at their robotics workspace, so it would make sense for the door to open upwards and not outwards. Secondly, I had to make the enclosure easy to open and close while still providing a good seal to keep in sound and dust. Lastly, I had to make all of the parts in this enclosure with just a circular saw, because that is the only wood cutting tool I have at home. With all of those design constraints, let's get into the design!

Like almost all of my projects, I start in CAD to lay out a couple ideas. I went back and forth between having just half of the top enclosure panel included in the door assembly like some other diy designs I have seen or the entire top. I decided to go with including the entire top panel as a part of the door to raise the open height and make it easier to work in the enclosure. Including the entire top panel would require a stronger gas spring to keep the door open, but I found a good deal on a pair of gas springs. The design includes a drawer under the enclosure to give easy access to essential CNC router tools.

Here is a fun picture of me drilling inside of the enclosure for a size reference. Except for the gas springs, I was able to buy all of the parts for this CNC router enclosure at my local hardware store. I was able to cut some of the large 4’ x 8’ sheets down at the hardware store, which saved me some time. As for assembly, I have a very detailed build log and instructions on [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Ultimate-CNC-Router-Enclosure/). Aside from waiting for the paint to dry, I was able to build this entire thing in a single afternoon.

The CNC router sits comfortably inside of the enclosure and with the door open, there is easy access to the entire machine. I attached some door sealer foam on the edges of the door to better seal sound and dust when closed. Polycarbonate windows provide good visibility and light into the enclosure.

I attached the gas springs in the perfect position to hold the door open at any height. Only slight force is needed to change the open angle of the door. An advantage of the door holding itself open at any height is that if there is a workpiece longer than the cnc router, it can still be machined safely with part of it sticking out of the front of the enclosure.

This CNC router build was enjoyable and it was nice to see it all come together. I think this CNC router setup will be an important prototyping and manufacturing tool for the students.
